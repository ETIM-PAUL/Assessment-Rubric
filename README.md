# Meta Checks
Meta Checks is a simple smart contract that implements basic solidity checks using require, revert and assert.

## Description
The contract has functions that allows you to create orders, cancel orders as well as ship the orders.
Checks have been implemented in these functions using require, revert and assert keywords. 
These checks include making sure an order exist before updating status, an order that is to 
be cancelled hasn't been shipped yet, etc.
